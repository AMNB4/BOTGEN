Disclaimer: This bot doesn't generate accounts out of thin air, you need stock.
## Info
I haven't tested this but it might have some optimization issues with big files (2mb+) but otherwise it works well.     
It deletes the account it generates. So the accounts are unique and people can't get the same account twice.

## How to use?
Its simple, all you have to do is put your accounts into the accounts folder, user:pass or mail:pass. They need to be in a .txt file otherwise the bot cant find them. There is also a example.txt file inside accounts folder.

To generate accounts just use 

    /gen [name of the text file, without the .txt at the end]

You can also check stock by doing /stock

## To do
* Better optimization for bigger txt files.    
* Maybe add a cooldown to gen command   

cant think of anything else atm
