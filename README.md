Disclaimer: This bot doesn't generate accounts out of thin air, you need stock.

## How to use?
Its simple, create your bot in discord.dev. Put the discord bot token into config.json file then put your guild-id that your bot is in and you're done. To add accounts simply create .txt files and put your accounts in them mail:pass or user:pass. You can also add full capture there, since the bot copies the full line and sends it to the user who generated the account.

To generate accounts just use 

    /gen [name of the text file, without the .txt at the end]
    /pgen - for premium users

You can also check stock by doing /stock
